# üöÄ DIY SME Management System - Self-Development Plan
> SUPERSEDED ‚Äì Live consolidated plan: `docs/CANONICAL_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`.
*Date: August 9, 2025*
*Decision: Build it ourselves without external developers*

---

## üéØ Why DIY is Better

### ‚úÖ **Advantages of Building Ourselves:**
1. **Complete Control** - We understand every line of code
2. **No Misleading Designs** - Build based on actual needs, not fantasy documents
3. **Deep Learning** - Understand the system inside-out
4. **Cost Effective** - No developer fees, no miscommunication costs
5. **Realistic Timeline** - No disappointment from wrong estimates
6. **Customizable** - Change direction anytime based on real user feedback

### üí™ **We Have Strong Foundation Already:**
- **Authentication System**: Complete and Production-Ready ‚úÖ
- **User Management**: Fully functional with CRUD operations ‚úÖ 
- **Database & API**: Setup and working perfectly ‚úÖ
- **Frontend Foundation**: React + Vite + TailwindCSS ready ‚úÖ
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Railway production environment ‚úÖ

### **Phase 2: HR Module (6-8 weeks) - Starting Now**

#### **Week 1-2: Employee Management Foundation**
```markdown
üéØ Goal: Create basic employee directory

Backend Tasks:
- [ ] Add employee fields to users table (department, position, employee_id)
- [ ] Create employee API endpoints
- [ ] Add employee validation and business logic

Frontend Tasks:
- [ ] Create EmployeeList component
- [ ] Create EmployeeForm (add/edit employees)
- [ ] Create EmployeeProfile page
- [ ] Add employee navigation menu

Database Changes:
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN department VARCHAR(100);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN position VARCHAR(100);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN employee_id VARCHAR(20);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN hire_date DATE;

Success Criteria:
‚úÖ Can view list of all employees
‚úÖ Can add new employee with department/position
‚úÖ Can edit employee information
‚úÖ Employee profile shows complete information
```

#### **Week 3-4: Leave Management System**
```markdown
üéØ Goal: Employees can request leave, managers can approve

Backend Tasks:
- [ ] Create leaves table and model
- [ ] Create leave CRUD API endpoints
- [ ] Add approval workflow logic
- [ ] Add leave balance calculation

Frontend Tasks:
- [ ] Create LeaveRequest form
- [ ] Create LeaveList (my leaves)
- [ ] Create LeaveApproval page (for managers)
- [ ] Create LeaveCalendar view

Database Schema:
CREATE TABLE leaves (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    leave_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- sick, vacation, personal
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    end_date DATE NOT NULL,
    days DECIMAL(3,1) NOT NULL,
    reason TEXT,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending', -- pending, approved, rejected
    requested_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    approved_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    approved_at TIMESTAMP,
    notes TEXT
);

Success Criteria:
‚úÖ Employees can submit leave requests
‚úÖ Managers can see pending requests
‚úÖ Managers can approve/reject with comments
‚úÖ Leave history is tracked
‚úÖ Basic leave balance calculation
```

#### **Week 5-6: Polish & Additional Features**
```markdown
üéØ Goal: Make HR module production-ready

Enhancement Tasks:
- [ ] Add leave calendar view
- [ ] Add basic reporting (who's out when)
- [ ] Add email notifications (optional)
- [ ] Add leave balance tracking
- [ ] Improve UI/UX based on testing

Testing & Integration:
- [ ] End-to-end testing of HR workflows
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness check
- [ ] Integration with existing auth system

Success Criteria:
‚úÖ HR module is user-friendly
‚úÖ All features work smoothly
‚úÖ No bugs in critical workflows
‚úÖ Ready for real-world usage
```

### **Phase 3: Project Management (Next 6-8 weeks after Phase 2)**
```markdown
üéØ Basic project tracking for SME

Features to Build:
- Customer management (CRUD)
- Project/job tracking
- Project status updates
- Basic project reporting
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Strategy

### **1. Incremental Development**
- Build one feature completely before moving to next
- Test each feature thoroughly with real scenarios
- Keep existing authentication system untouched
- Add features to existing codebase, don't rebuild

### **2. Simple First, Enhance Later**
- Start with basic CRUD operations
- Add complexity only when needed
- Focus on user needs, not comprehensive features
- Perfect small things before adding big things

### **3. Use What Works**
- Extend existing user table instead of creating complex HR tables
- Follow patterns already established in codebase
- Reuse existing components and styling
- Keep consistent with current UI/UX

### **4. Real-World Testing**
- Test each feature with actual use cases
- Get feedback from potential users
- Fix issues immediately before moving forward
- Document what works and what doesn't
