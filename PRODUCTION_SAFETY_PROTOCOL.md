# üõ°Ô∏è Production Safety Protocol
**Date**: August 11, 2025  
**Project**: SME Management System  
**Status**: LIVE PRODUCTION SYSTEM

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL PRODUCTION WARNINGS**

### **üö® PRODUCTION STATUS**
```yaml
Environment: LIVE PRODUCTION
Backend: https://web-production-5b6ab.up.railway.app
Database: PostgreSQL on Railway (LIVE DATA)
Users: Real users with real data
Deployment: Auto-deploy from main branch
```

### **üîí SAFETY FIRST RULES**

#### **1. NEVER Direct Main Branch Changes**
```bash
# ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS IN PRODUCTION
git push origin main  # Direct to production!

# ‚úÖ ALWAYS USE FEATURE BRANCHES
git checkout -b feature/hr-enhancements
git push origin feature/hr-enhancements
# Then create Pull Request for review
```

#### **2. Database Changes Protocol**
```bash
# ‚ùå NEVER run migrations without backup
alembic upgrade head  # Dangerous!

# ‚úÖ ALWAYS backup first
# 1. Backup database
# 2. Test migration in staging
# 3. Apply with rollback plan
```

#### **3. Testing Protocol**
```bash
# ‚úÖ ALWAYS test locally first
# 1. Local development testing
# 2. Staging environment (if available)
# 3. Production deployment with monitoring
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è **SAFE DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW**

### **Step 1: Create Feature Branch**
```bash
cd /home/safety/sme-management
git checkout -b feature/hr-dashboard-safely
git push -u origin feature/hr-dashboard-safely
```

### **Step 2: Local Development & Testing**
```bash
# Start local backend (development DB)
cd backend
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:smepass123@localhost:5432/sme_management_dev"
python3 -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

# Start local frontend  
cd ../frontend
npm run dev  # localhost:3001

# Test thoroughly before any push
```

### **Step 3: Staging Testing (Recommended)**
```bash
# Create staging environment on Railway (separate from production)
# Test all changes in staging first
# Get user acceptance testing
```

### **Step 4: Production Deployment**
```bash
# Only after thorough testing
git checkout main
git merge feature/hr-dashboard-safely
git push origin main  # Auto-deploys to production
```

---

## üîß **SAFE CHANGE PROCEDURES**

### **For Backend Changes**
```bash
1. Create feature branch
2. Test locally with development database
3. Update tests (if applicable)
4. Code review (even if solo - double-check)
5. Gradual rollout with monitoring
```

### **For Database Schema Changes**
```bash
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Database backup first
2. Create migration in feature branch
3. Test migration locally
4. Document rollback procedure
5. Apply during low-usage hours
6. Monitor for errors immediately
```

### **For Frontend Changes**
```bash
1. Test locally with production API
2. Check all existing features still work
3. Test on different browsers/devices
4. Gradual deployment with rollback plan
```

---

## üö® **EMERGENCY PROCEDURES**

### **If Production Breaks**
```bash
1. Immediate Response:
   - Check Railway deployment status
   - Check application logs
   - Verify database connectivity

2. Quick Fix:
   - If recent deployment caused issue:
     git revert <commit-hash>
     git push origin main  # Immediate rollback
   
3. Communication:
   - Log the incident
   - Document the fix
   - Update safety procedures
```

### **Database Emergency**
```bash
1. If data corruption suspected:
   - DO NOT make more changes
   - Contact Railway support
   - Use database backup for recovery

2. If migration failed:
   - Check alembic current status
   - Use alembic downgrade if safe
   - Restore from backup if needed
```

## üìã **SAFE DEVELOPMENT CHECKLIST**

### **Before Any Change**
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Local testing completed
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database backup (if schema changes)
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

### **Before Production Deploy**
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Admin login still works
- [ ] Existing features unaffected

### **After Production Deploy**
- [ ] Monitor Railway logs for errors
- [ ] Test admin login immediately
- [ ] Check key features work
- [ ] Monitor for user complaints
- [ ] Document any issues found

---

## üîç **MONITORING & ALERTS**

### **Manual Checks** (Daily)
```bash
# Health check
curl https://web-production-5b6ab.up.railway.app/health

# Admin login test  
curl -X POST https://web-production-5b6ab.up.railway.app/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}'

# Employee count check
# (Test that HR endpoints work)
```

### **Error Monitoring**
- Railway application logs
- Browser console errors (frontend)
- Database query performance
- API response times

---

## üìö **PRODUCTION CHANGE LOG**

### **August 11, 2025**
```
15:52 - Created Production Safety Protocol
- Established safe development workflow
- Created feature branch strategy
- Added emergency procedures
- Set up monitoring checklist
```

### **Previous Changes**
```
Earlier today - HR Role Support Added
- Added HR role to authentication system
- Created HR management router (not yet in production)

```

---

## üéØ **NEXT DEVELOPMENT TASKS (SAFE APPROACH)**

### **Task 1: HR User Creation (Low Risk)**
```bash
# Create HR user through existing API
# No code changes needed
# Safe to do in production
```

### **Task 2: Frontend Railway Deployment (Medium Risk)**
```bash  
# Deploy frontend to separate Railway service
# Test thoroughly before switching traffic
# Keep rollback plan ready
```

### **Task 3: HR Dashboard Features (High Risk)**
```bash
# Requires new code deployment
# Must use feature branch workflow
# Extensive testing required
```

---

## üîê **ACCESS CONTROL**

### **Production Access**
```yaml
Railway Dashboard: 
  - Only authorized personnel
  - Enable 2FA if available
  - Monitor access logs

GitHub Repository:
  - Protected main branch (if possible)
  - Require pull request reviews
  - No direct pushes to main

Admin Credentials:
  - Change regularly
  - Use strong passwords
  - Monitor admin actions
```

---

## üìû **CONTACT INFORMATION**

```yaml
Emergency Contacts:
  - Railway Support: (if issues)
  - Database Admin: (for data recovery)
  - Project Owner: (for business decisions)

Documentation:
  - This file: Production Safety Protocol
  - MASTER_PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md: Complete project info
  - QUICK_AI_HANDOVER_GUIDE.md: Emergency reference
```

---

**üö® REMEMBER: When in doubt, DON'T deploy to production!**  
**Test locally first, use feature branches, and always have a rollback plan.**

*This protocol must be updated after each production incident or major change.*
